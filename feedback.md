### Sophistication of your design

Your implementation of a cat is good, and its two functionalities work well. It would be nice to see more states being implemented, or have the cat require different interactions over time. e.g. Can the cat get hungry after feeding it? A state showing the cat wanting to be shaked would also be cool.

### Sophistication of your implementation

Your implementation is decent for what you have created, good use of memory for storing the states of the cat!
It would have been nice to see more functionality implemented for interrupts, maybe enabling an additional timer to show the cat getting hungry or needing attention. The rings 0-2 are also touch sensitive and could have been used for more interaction. 

### Sophistication of analysis and evaluation

You have explained what your cat does fairly well, however it would be nice to see why you ended up with this program.
e.g. What was your motivation behind the design? Did you struggle implementing anything in particular? Is there anything you would do differently? Do you have any ideas to extend your program?

### Sophistication of communication and expression

Clear language and structuring of design document, having a title/headings as well as diagrams would be appreciated.
