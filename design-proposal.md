For the assignment 2, a digital cat will be created, which contains states such as hungry level, happiness. 
Two buttons are used. One for feeding the cat, the other one for treating the cat. They decrease the hungry level or increase the happiness level.
For different state levels, the cat has related behaviours. For example, if the hungry level is high, the cat moves less.
The states of the digital pet are stored in memory. Buttons are implemented with interrupts.
If there is much left time, sound is implemented that is related to the current states.
